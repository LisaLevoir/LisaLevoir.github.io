    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "About me\nI am a professional biostatistician located in the Twin Cities. I’m interested in using my skills to make the world a better place. While this is a lofty goal, keeping this direction in mind helps me get up each day and contribute to the best of my ability.\nIn the past, I worked in cutting edge research labs on topics related to immunology and virology. I’ve always found our biology fascinating - if you stop and think about all of the processes that are working all day, every day, that keep us running generally without even having to think about it, it’s pretty amazing. Sometimes when I did molecular biology experiments like setting up a PCR it would feel like performing witchcraft by pipetting small amounts of invisible liquid, warming them up in a very particular way, and then visualizing a ladder band in a gel I poured. Assuredly, it is not actually witchcraft!\nStatistical research can also start to seem like magic, but the hope is that we can gather useful insights from limited resources. Whether there are only so many available study volunteers, research funds, or bandwidth available in a lab or clinical setting, or (name your limiting factor), we hope to make the most use out of what we have.\nMaking the most out of what we have is motivating to me. Since this is my “about me” page and I can say whatever I want, I think it’s also important to recognize the limits of math, medicine, and science. I strive to focus on the people involved. We should value who is contributing to our research and who is performing, communicating, and implementing research findings.\n\nLet’s connect\nThank you for visiting my website. If you’d like to reach out, please feel free to reach out on LinkedIn. I’m happy to answer questions about my academic and professional journey and share advice with students and young professionals.\n\nReach out on LinkedIn!"

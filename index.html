        <sub>Mayo Clinic | May 2015 - Aug. 2015</sub>
        <p>
          My main objective was to understand how regulatory T cells (Tregs)
          interact with innate lymphoid cells and Th-17 cells to maintain gut
          homeostasis, and the role of IL-10 in this crosstalk. The project
          culminated in an undergraduate poster session and presentation to the
          Mayo Graduate School Immunology department.

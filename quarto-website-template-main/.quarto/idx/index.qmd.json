I’ve always found our biology fascinating - if you stop and think about all of the processes that are working all day, every day, that keep us running generally without even having to think about it, it’s pretty amazing.

Whether there are only so many available study volunteers, research funds, or bandwidth available in a lab or clinical setting, or (name your limiting factor), we hope to make the most use out of what we have.\n\n**Making the most out of what we have is motivating to me**. Since this is my “about me” page and I can say whatever I want, I think it’s also important to recognize the limits of math, medicine, and science. I strive to focus on the people involved.
